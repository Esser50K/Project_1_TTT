#WDI: First Project

11:00 pm May 7 --- I spent roughly 3.5 hours working on my project.  I began by plotting out how I was going to attack
the game from a logistical standpoint.  I mapped it out on paper before opening my text editor.  I just deleted almost
all of my javascript as I don't believe it's any good.  I'm going to focus tomorrow on going bit by bit and working my
way up.

May 8 --- I think I finally figured out how to run the game.  I need to have the divs and and button to listen for a click in the global scope as opposed to the local scope.  This was my biggest sticking point.  Now, I'm having issues with the boxes collapsing when I hit the reset button.

5:00pm --- I can't seem to fix the reset button.  I don't understand why it's not working.  It seems that I'm spending most of my time on trivial issues.  I think I have the logic down however.

6:10pm --- I don't know how to do anything
